# Lens X Astrace Natal Chart App

An app that generates natal charts based on a person's birth information. The natal charts are "minted" as [Lens Publications](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication) and the birth information is stored as metadata in the minters Lens [ProfileNFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile). The repo is organized into four main components: natal chart generation, deployment code, frontend, and smart contracts.
